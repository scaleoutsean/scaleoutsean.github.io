        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When using Python with SolidFire I usually use SolidFire Python SDK which in turn uses requests and <a href="https://github.com/solidfire/solidfire-sdk-python/blob/49fe23e2e9383dcd75723d680ffd18a475dccea5/solidfire/common/__init__.py">urllib3</a>.</p>

<p>One opportunity for performance enhancement with scripts that issue a lot of Get and List API requests is asynchronous access to the SolidFire API.</p>

<p>Opportunities should be evaluated in the context of use case and application behavior. Get and List requests in monitoring applications are usually async-safe and the same should apply to long-running jobs which are asynchronous on SolidFire as well (e.g. cloning or backup-to-S3).</p>

<p>Python’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code> provides ways to safely use other methods, but that requires more effort and skill. In this post I only want to evaluate its viability in simple &amp; low risk use cases.</p>

<p>(Async IO isn’t limited to Python clients - it’s just that I will use Python in this particular post.)</p>

<h2 id="simple-example">Simple example</h2>

<p>Here’s a simple example, a loop that makes 100 calls to GetSnmpInfo method over HTTPS (using valid TLS certificate, so there’s no time spent on warnings or errors).</p>

<p>That test doesn’t create much load on the system, it’s a very simple API request.</p>

<p>Using SolidFire Python SDK, create a loop that does this 100 times:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">sfe</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_snmp_info</span><span class="p">()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To try with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requests</code>, use their basic examples and access the SolidFire API endpoint (“MVIP”) directly, without the SDK.</p>

<p>And the same with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code> - just use one of the basic examples with Basic Authentication from their <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_quickstart.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s how that unscientific test (100 x <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetSnmpInfo</code>) worked on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Python 3.10.12 and SolidFire Demo VM 12.5 on ESXi. HTTPS (TLS) was used in all tests. SolidFire API endpoints run behind built-in NGINX (reverse proxy API gateway) which uses HTTP 1.1 - that’s the “HTTP server”.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Client</th>
      <th>seconds</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">SolidFire Python SDK</td>
      <td>3.35</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">requests</td>
      <td>3.45</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">aiohttp</td>
      <td>2.90</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In all cases it was just a simple loop (with aiohttp - asynchronous) with 100 API calls.</p>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code> is used to create 100 async <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">task</code>s which are then executed in own async HTTP(S) sessions, and the results gathered with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gather(*tasks)</code>, it takes just 1.65 seconds! But that’s a bit more complicated to use and requires better skills than I currently have.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-worth-the-trouble">Is it worth the trouble?</h2>

<p>First, it’s strange that Requests was slower than SolidFire SDK which uses requests, but anyway.</p>

<p>Even compared to SolidFire Python SDK, I get more than a 10% performance improvement with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’d have to do a lot more work without the SDK, and I may not really that extra performance.</p>

<p>So at this time I don’t want to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code>, but it may come handy for selected requests in <a href="/2024/05/03/netapp-solidfire-collector-next.html">SolidFire Collector</a> - those which are many, such as some of the busiest functions from that instrumentation chart in the linked post.</p>

<h2 id="real-life-examples">Real-life examples</h2>

<h3 id="chunky-responses-to-default-list-and-get-requests">Chunky responses to “default” List and Get requests</h3>

<p>As a better, “real-life” example, a SolidFire’s QoS Histogram (see the SolidFire Collector article) object has 14 keys in 5 metrics, which is 70 JSON “documents” per each volume (approximately 1kB per volume).</p>

<p>If you have 500 volumes and ask for a QoS histogram chart, that’s one giant response with thousands of records, which is a huge response compared to most other API responses that SolidFire does.  HCI Collector does that - it just sends one huge requests which probably works great if you have 20-200 volumes, which is likely 90% of SolidFire users out there.</p>

<p>A 1 MB response to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ListVolumeQoSHistograms</code> sent to a cluster with 1000 volumes isn’t going to “crash” SolidFire. But it may slow down other requests and take a second to complete.</p>

<p>Another extreme would be to send 500 requests with 500 responses of approximately 1 kB each. This increases the use of CPU on the SolidFire node where API endpoint is located.</p>

<p>What I do in SolidFire Collector (v2 alpha) is something in between: I batch volume IDs in requests, so that I can send one or 20, and all but one be “medium” size. This is where farming those out to a dozen parallel <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code> requests would be useful. (Multi)threading is also helpful here, but that only parallelizes work and after some success may create more blocking and contention so a combination of both is more helpful than multithreading alone.</p>

<h3 id="single-object-requests-that-need-to-be-repeated">Single-object requests that need to be repeated</h3>

<p>Yet another situation is some SolidFire API methods that work on a single object (no list can be passed).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetAccountEfficiency</code> is one such example. There’s no way to get efficiency for 2 or all accounts. It has to be one by one - maybe because each request makes the API get all the volumes owned by an account and already does a lot of work to get that response back.</p>

<p>With those there’s no choice - one has to send a bunch of requests to get a bunch of responses. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code> can make all of them non-blocking.</p>

<h3 id="json-rpc">JSON-RPC</h3>

<p>Note that in my test above I used simple JSON-RPC that didn’t have to be URL-encoded.</p>

<p>For non-trivial use we’d have to use a JSON-RPC integration for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code> or do the same work ourselves, by “manually” creating JSON payload for aiohttp requests.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/expert-m/aiohttp-rpc">JSON-RPC projects for asyncio on Github</a>, but I have not yet tried them. Manual assembly of POST requests works  - it’s less productive, but doesn’t have external dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Async IO isn’t needed for “fast performance”.</p>

<p>Also, I <em>don’t want</em> fast performance for my scripts because SolidFire API endpoints have more important users (such as vSphere Plugin or NetApp Trident) than my scripts.</p>

<p>I just want the ability to handle all requests optimally without stalling SolidFire or my program. Async IO can do that: if I remember correctly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code> creates up to 100 connections which I seem to remember is well within the SolidFire’s API endpoint’s limit (not for SolidFire Demo VM, but for hardware appliances).</p>

<p>There are other ways to get more out of Python, but I don’t think I’ll need to use them with SolidFire.</p>

<p>I may consider using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aiohttp</code> in SolidFire Collector and <a href="/2024/04/24/netapp-solidfire-monitor-backup-influx-grafana-11.html">backup-to-S3 scripts</a> because there may be 20-30 volume jobs to keep track of plus a fair number of requests to a metrics database and notifications services.</p>
