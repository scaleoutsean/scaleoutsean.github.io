<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The idea behind <a href="https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/hardened_repository_immutability.html">Veeam Hardened Repository</a> is simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Linux box runs the Veeam Data Mover Service (veeamtransport) and the Veeam Immutability Service (veeamimmureposvc)</li>
  <li>The latter "checks file immutability attributes every 20 minutes, calculates the time until a file needs to be immutable, and sets or removes the immutable attribute" (on backup files stored on XFS filesystem)</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the free (and far less featured) approaches there's <a href="/2022/04/03/restic-server-netapp-eseries.html">Rest Server</a> for Restic clients, and <a href="https://scaleoutsean.github.io/2023/09/03/solidbackup-with-kopia.html">Kopia</a>.</p>

<p>So, does Veeam Hardened Repository (let's call it VHR) support E-Series or vice versa?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2 id="longer-answer">Longer answer</h2>

<p>E-Series is a popular choice for Veeam backup repositories. Some time ago I recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzk3ZpfT-Y">this demo</a> of Veeam scale-out backup and restore with E-Series, and the NetApp web site has a technical report ("TR") with integration details.</p>

<p>That TR does not cover VHR, though.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/hardened_repository_limitations.html">requirements</a> for VHR are simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu server with RAID1 on SSDs with at least 100 GB disk space for boot disk</li>
  <li>Repository can be RAID6 or RAID60 with stripe size 128 or 256 KB</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to boot from SAN. That's not a bad idea, by the way, because then you can take OS snapshots on E-Series and can replace the server with some fiddling (need to remap client identity and possibly reset network MAC addresses and such, if there's anything hard-coded).</p>

<p>But many users prefer to use internal disks and in that case you'd use E-Series only for backup data.</p>

<p>I'd recommend using <a href="/2021/07/06/e-series-ddp-expansion-and-rebalancing.html">DDP</a> over RAID6, but both are fine. DDP gives you more flexibility in configuration <em>and</em> expansion without significant performance penalty.</p>

<p>The thing with DDP is you need at least 11 disks (whereas with RAID 6 you can get away with 10, but if you add a hot spare that DDP doesn't need, you still need 11).</p>

<p>I'm not sure how important is the requirement to use 128 or 256 KB stripe size because I haven't tested VHR or seen technical reports that show the difference between "common" stripe sizes (1024 KB) and small (128 KB) which is the case here.</p>

<p>If a Veeam consultant tells you it's important, then use RAID6 and set it correctly when creating data volumes. I'd go with RAID 6 and 32 KiB unless I knew 512 KiB is okay. That also means <strong>no DDP unless you know better</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Volume group (such as RAID6) - pick 32 KiB segment size</li>
  <li>Dynamic Disk Pool (DDP) - fixed 128 KB segment size, resulting in 128 KiB x 8 = 512 KiB stripe size</li>
  <li>More smaller disks is better - because of small IO sizes and HDDs, you need IOPS so use small disks such as 4 TB NL-SAS if you can</li>
</ul>

<p>For reference, E-Series' segment size is documented <a href="https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/e-series-santricity/sm-storage/what-is-segment-sizing.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-notes">Other notes</h2>

<p>If we use RAID6 here, then best practices for E-Series mandate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RAID6 volume groups should be 8+2 (10 per group). If you can't follow best practices, you may as well use DDP and ignore other items</li>
  <li>Number of disks will be 10 or its multiple (plus at least 1 hot spare per array)</li>
  <li>You shouldn't grow capacity by adding 3 or 9 disks later; storage growth should be in (integer) multiples of 10 disks and with smaller disks (4TB or 8TB) you could have just one volume per RAID6 group</li>
</ul>

<p>DAS can work, SAN can also work. If you want a lower cost you could use DAS and not have any SAN switches (iSCSI, FC, IB).</p>

<p>If you target &lt; 10 GB/s, you may use iSCSI with DAS - it's only inexpensive, it's not <a href="/2020/12/05/iscsi-vs-fibre-channel-fc-performance.html">"slow"</a>. You can also use IB and <a href="/2023/09/22/ubuntu-lts-netapp-eseries-iser.html">iSER</a> without IB switches, which is fast but requires some fiddling as you can see in that post. Of course, most people default to FC for both DAS and SAN.</p>

<p>How much performance? E-Series 2800 is single digit GB/s and 5700 is 10 GB/s (both write). <strong>But</strong>, the requirements imply that IOs are small, i.e. 32 KiB, so we cannot use purely sequential guesstimates here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>See <a href="/2020/12/30/netapp-hci-ef280-diskspd-for-backup.html">this</a> for examples of a single VM performance (with EF280 with <em>SSDs</em>, though). Tests from this link have no 32 KiB request sizes, there's just one 100% sequential write test (1.7 GiB/s) which doesn't apply here (as I said, you'll have HDDs and smaller request sizes)</li>
  <li>When buying E-Series, you should probably ask for throughput estimate based on a 32 KiB write I/O workload (100% write, for backup) or some mix (maybe 80% write, 20% read)</li>
  <li>If you want to use encrypted disks (media), ask for FED/SED/FIPS disks and check the SANtricity TR-4712 and product documentation for information on supported (external) KMIP servers</li>
</ul>

<p>Say you have 30 NL-SAS disks in 3 RAID6 groups. Using 4 KiB requests and a 50/50 read-write ratio, that would be around 80 IOPS per disk or some 2,500 K in 4 KiB IOPS. But if requests are 32 KiB and the ratio 80/20, 50 MB/s should be possible.</p>

<p>Whatever figure you get, you shouldn't assume that will be your maximum backup performance. Data is compressed and deduplicated, so assuming some backup data is 100 GiB, 5 GiB changed, and after Veeam efficiencies only 2 GiB need to be written to disk. If we have 30 disks, the above figure (50 MiB * 80% = 40 MiB/s), writing 2 GiB of data would take 50 seconds. This is probably mildly incorrect - I didn't RTFM (Veeam) - but it shows you how to make educated guesses on your own.</p>

<h2 id="disk-snapshots-and-security">Disk snapshots and security</h2>

<p>The last bit here is to say a few things about E-Series snapshots and such, considering this is supposed to be hardened i.e. "almost immutable":</p>

<ul>
  <li>See the second part of the post about <a href="/2022/04/03/restic-server-netapp-eseries.html">Rest Server</a> for some things you can do to further protect these volumes</li>
  <li>E-Series snapshots are confusing, I must say. But anyway - check out <a href="/2023/10/05/snapshots-and-consistency-groups-with-netapp-e-series.html">this post</a> for some ideas on how to automate snapshot creation using the SANtricity API</li>
  <li>You can use E-Series Performance Analyzer to monitor, or even use the API to integrate with whatever else you use. <a href="/2023/10/12/snapshot-clone-repository-monitoring-in-eseries.html">Here</a> is an example of monitoring E-Series snapshots in PRTG (there are other posts for other things)</li>
  <li>For overall security see <a href="https://www.netapp.com/media/17079-tr4712.pdf">TR-4712</a>. You can set up SAML and KMIP (only if you buy SED/FED/FIPS HDDs!), for example, to protect E-Series management interfaces from unauthorized access</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="e-series-vs-internal-raid">E-Series vs. internal RAID</h2>

<p>This sometimes comes up.</p>

<p>There aren't many servers out there that can accommodate 50 or 250 3.5" NL-SAS drives.</p>

<p>If they do, you still have a SPOF (the server itself) which means you need another one to replicate, performance may be mediocre, etc.</p>

<h3 id="hardened-repository-volumes-on-e-series-with-primary-data-copy">Hardened repository volumes on E-Series with primary data copy</h3>

<p>If your production data is on E-Series, should you use the same array for VHR?</p>

<p>I tend to think that "it depends". I'm 70% against, and 30% in favor.</p>

<p>Against using the same E-Series array for VHR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you lose the E-Series array due to multiple hardware problems, you'll lose VHR with its backup data as well. This is extremely unlikely, but not impossible.</li>
  <li>If your E-Series gets hacked, the hacker can delete all volumes (both production data and VHR data)</li>
  <li>If you can get away with using a dedicated 2U server with NL-SAS for VHR, that's more secure and the cost of disks should be similar</li>
</ul>

<p>In favor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 2U server with internal disks is a good approach cost-wise, but if your backup size grows you'll need a 4U server and won't have system redundancy. For VHRs that will grow beyond 2U server capacity, I'd rather use a dedicated E-Series array (e.g. E-2812 or better)</li>
  <li>E-Series is redundant, servers are not (unless you have 2 or more and replicate, but then you'd be better off with a dedicated E-2812)</li>
  <li>Proper security practices should be in place for E-Series (SAML and 2FA, for example, with SANtricity management interface on a dedicated network), significantly lowering the risk of hacker penetration</li>
</ul>

<p>If we assume management interfaces of our E-Series cannot be properly secured and want to mitigate that risk for backups, VHR's repositories should not reside on E-Series.</p>

<p>If we make two copies (e.g. cloud and on-prem), then that risk may be acceptable. Also - as discussed above - if our backup data requires a 4U server then another E-Series array is likely a more economical way store VHR data.</p>

<h2 id="relevant-e-series-configuration-steps">Relevant E-Series configuration steps</h2>

<p>When you login to E-Series for the first time, you'll have a bunch of disks. You need to create a volume group (VG) or a pool (DDP; Dynamic Disk Pool) and then a volume or volumes. These screenshots may be open in another window/tab for easier viewing.</p>

<p>This screenshot shows how easy DDP is - you select a bunch of disks (240) and internally SANtricity will write all over the place in a RAID6-fashion (stripes of 8+2, 128 KiB):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The pool:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Pool properties let you fine-tune reconstruction (similar to "RAID rebuild", but faster and pool-wide as stripes are all over the pool):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notice "Preservation capacity" (space reserved for pool reconstruction) - here it's 7 because this DDP is huge. For a small one you'd have 1 or 2, similar to Hot Spares for with VGs.</p>

<p>To create a RAID6 VG (better, as it lets you follow the stripe size recommendation), you'd have to use a supported number of disks (such as 20, but that's not a best practice (10 is) - I have 20 here just for a comparison with DDP).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-04.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here you can see DDP vs. R6 VG, both with 20 disks (that's why I used 20 disks in the RAID6 VG).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-05.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Don't bother comparing "usable" because it's not comparable for several reasons: first, you should use 10 disks in VG, and second, there's no Hot Spare (which ought to be present for VGs, but not required for DDPs).</p>

<p>In the case of VGs, if a disk fails and a Hot Spare kicks in, "Hot spare protected" will become Yes, whereas DDP would "reconstruct" and recover using internal pool capacity.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-06.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once we have our VG (or a pool) ready, the next step is to create a volume or volumes (if we have a large DDP or more than 1 VG):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-07.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This step shows how VG-based volumes can set segment size (refer to the reference link from the SANtricity documentation above). This is probably the main non-default step when creating volumes for a Veeam Hardened Repository. There are other best practices (e.g. for security, monitoring, etc.), of course.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/veeam-hardened-repository-eseries-08.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>DDP has no segment size option - it's fixed (128 KiB), as I mentioned earlier.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>E-Series is popular among Veeam users for its reliability, performance, economics and security and seems perfectly suited for Veeam Hardened Repository.</p>

<p>Unlike in the official NetApp Technical Report, RAID6 with a 32 KiB segment size may be necessary (with implications for performance sizing), and Veeam runs on a Linux OS.</p>

<p>Other than that, common best practices apply and although I haven't done hands-on testing, it seems simple and valuable for users who want a hardened backup repository attached to a secure, battle-proven external storage array.</p>
