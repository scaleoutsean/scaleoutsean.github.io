        <p>I’ve written a dozen posts about SolidFire’s <a href="/2021/04/21/solidfire-backup-to-s3.html">“backup to S3”</a>, so I’ll just skip all that and focus on Backblaze.</p>

<p>To test if SolidFire’s backup to S3 feature can work with Backblaze, I create a new bucket <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">solidfire-backup</code> (bucket name must be unique service-wide, so pick another name!).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-01.png" alt="Backblaze bucket for SolidFire backup" /></p>

<p>I didn’t use any special bucket settings.</p>

<p>I’ve blogged about Object Lock with SolidFire’s Backup to S3 before - I think it can be used, but you need to come up with a plan that is suitable for your needs.</p>

<p>Create the keys and you may limit the keys to have access <strong>only</strong> to your backup bucket.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-02.png" alt="Backblaze keys for SolidFire API access" /></p>

<p>You could have another bucket and another set of keys in another region, so that you can run another backup schedule for additional protection.</p>

<p>Now pick a volume fill in S3 API endpoint (it works without https:// or :443) for the bucket, bucket name and credentials and you’re good to go.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-05.png" alt="SolidFire backup to S3 with Backblaze details" /></p>

<p>Backup of volume “log” was successful:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-03.png" alt="Backblaze backup from SolidFire worked" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">solidfire-backup</code> is now no longer empty:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-04.png" alt="Backblaze backup with SolidFire data" /></p>

<p>The volume I backed up was a 1GiB empty volume and because I used Native data format (which compresses and deduplicates) backup data in the bucket is &lt;100 kB.</p>

<p>Because I use a SolidFire Demo VM at home, reads are usually storage-constrained. I was able to backup at 20+ MB/s (Max IOPS-constrained; you can see that Burst is higher but lasts a short time).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-12.png" alt="Backup to Backblaze maxed out SolidFire Demo VM" /></p>

<h2 id="restore-related-notes">Restore-related notes</h2>

<p>We can use a dedicated read-only pair of keys for restore. This is to prevent deletion as well as tampering with backup images.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-07.png" alt="Backblaze key pair for restore" /></p>

<p>Earlier I mentioned “pairing” of pre-created empty volumes and volume IDs with what we have in our backup bucket.</p>

<p>As I restore PROD-wcwb/log-2 (ClusterName - ClusterUuid / VolumeName - VolumeID) to new volume PROD-wcwb/test-25, I need to override the default path in the bucket to another volume.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PROD-wcwb/log-2 =&gt; PROD-wcwb/test-25</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-08.png" alt="Backblaze key pair for restore" /></p>

<p>If restore destination (cluster) was different, I would have changed that part (PROD-wcwb) as well. Restore was successful.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-09.png" alt="Backblaze restore to SolidFire volume successful" /></p>

<p>Here we can see the both volumes. Notice that the second volume is larger, so we know a backup of a smaller volume can be restored to a larger volume size.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/backblaze-solidfire-backup-to-s3-b2-10.png" alt="SolidFire source and destination volumes" /></p>

<p>That shows that it’s possible to create 10 16TiB volumes and use them to restore arbitrarily sized SolidFire volume backups (up to SolidFire maximum which is 16TiB).</p>

<h2 id="is-backblaze-supported">Is Backblaze supported?</h2>

<p>There’s no official compatibility list for S3-compatible services. If it works, it works.</p>

<p>Backblaze’s S3 API compatibility <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-s3-compatible-api">isn’t super-high</a>, so I was a bit worried (that I’d waste time), but it worked very nicely: I backed up 10 volumes (1GB of data, 75% full, ~3X global efficiency, 2x in-volume efficiency) and restored them. All 20 jobs successfully completed.</p>

<p>If you test it yourself, I’d recommend to create the largest SolidFire volume you plan to backup to Backblaze, fill it up to 90%, and then try to both backup and restore. Why?</p>

<p>Because some services may have obscure limitations that may not be readily visible.</p>

<p>For example, earlier today I found one S3 service (not Backblaze) where the maximum number of objects per bucket is limited to a very low figure. In fact it’s so low that you’d have to have very small SolidFire volumes, and use one bucket per each volume! (To make this worse, SolidFire’s backup-to-S3 always works with 4 MiB source volume chunks, so it can create thousands of objects per backed up volume, which is not good cost-wise if you’re charged for each S3 API call.)</p>

<p>So far I’ve tried SolidFire’s Backup to S3 with StorageGRID, ONTAP S3, MinIO (there was/is a bug in MinIO’s S3 APIs, it was worked around in one of SolidFire v12 updates), Wasabi, and Backblaze.</p>
