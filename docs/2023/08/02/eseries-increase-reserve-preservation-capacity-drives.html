        <h2 id="requirement">Requirement</h2>

<p>Some users want to start small and flexibly add disks in small increments (1, 2, 3) later.</p>

<p>For various reasons, DDP is a good match for that. The most obvious argument against using classic RAID is one isn’t supposed to create weird RAID 5 or 6 widths - it results in unpredictable (usually on the negative side) performance and the larger a RAID 5 or 6 group, the slower it rebuilds.</p>

<p>You can search this blog or the NetApp Web site for more on DDP vs. RAID 6.</p>

<p>There are two related questions (and answers):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can DDP be expanded in small increments without negative consequences - yes</li>
  <li>Can DDP “protection” capacity be increased as the pool grows to 60 or 120 or more drives - yes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>I wrote about DDP expansion before so I’ll focus on the second question first.</p>

<p>You may start with 20 drives and allocate 2 (common best practice for DDP for up to 2-3 dozen disks) for protection (the so-called DDP preservation capacity). But once you get to 60 drives, you may want to have three drives worth of spare capacity.</p>

<p>DDP preservation capacity is a disk pool setting that’s available here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In SANtricity System Manager, go to * Storage* &gt; <em>Pools and Volumes</em>  and select your DDP</li>
  <li>Click on <em>View/Edit Settings</em></li>
  <li>Go to the modal’s second tab, <em>Pool Settings</em> and scroll all the way down</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-00.png" alt="DDP Pool Settings" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>At the very bottom you’ll be offered to * update*  (yes!!!) the pool’s preservation capacity.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-01.png" alt="DDP Preservation Capacity" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Change it (e.g. from 3 to 4) and hit <em>Save</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Now the pool should have a slightly reduced capacity (by 1 disk) as 1 disk worth of capacity was assigned to preservation.</p>

<p>The “Why can’t I increase” question is concerning, so let’s check that link. What TFM <a href="https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/e-series-santricity/sm-storage/why-cant-i-increase-my-preservation-capacity.html">says</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have created volumes on all available usable capacity, you cannot increase preservation capacity without adding capacity to the pool by either adding drives or deleting volumes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All right, no big deal - if you’re on 3 and you’ve used up all space for data, you won’t be able to increase that to 4 until you add another disk to the pool. Makes sense.</p>

<p>I was able to both shrink (go from 4 to 3) and grow (from 3 to 4) DDP preservation setting.</p>

<p>(FYI, this particular screenshot was taken on E-Series simulator v11.73, something that’s handy for quick checks of how SANtricity Web UI works. E-Series Simulator is available to NetApp employees and partners.)</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

<p>I put one of these experiments in a short <a href="https://rumble.com/v3415px-expand-e-series-ddp-pool-and-grow-and-shrink-its-preservation-capacity.html">demo video</a> (2m6s).</p>

<p>It’s annotated and easy to understand, so you can mute it if you don’t like the voiceover.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By default, DDP has performance characteristics similar to RAID 6. It requires 11 disks to start, but then you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2021/07/06/e-series-ddp-expansion-and-rebalancing.html">Grow DDP</a> in increments between 1 and many disks</li>
  <li>Start with a small DDP preservation setting (e.g. 2 out of 11 at first) and grow it to 3 or 4 as your DDP hits 30 or 60 or 100 drives</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<p>For a closer look at the expansion and changes, here are some additional screenshots:</p>

<p>Create a new DDP from 20 “7.68” TB drives.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-02-new-20-drive-dpp.png" alt="Create new DDP from 20 drives" /></p>

<p>Let’s examine the DDP’s properties: these particular drives are 7,319.85 GiB large and the total usable DDP capacity is 104,312 GiB (see the details on capacity calculation in the Appendix at the bottom.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-03-new-20-drive-dpp-settings.png" alt="DDP properties" /></p>

<p>Now let’s add 10 more drives, naively thinking that should increase the capacity by 50% (it won’t exactly).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interestingly, the size of these drives - due to them being made by a different manufacturer, for example - are 7,324.85 GiB, so when confirming our action we get a warning that only 7319.85 (5 GiB less) will be used as that’s the size of the smallest drive in the original 20 disk group used in this pool</li>
  <li>10 drives amount to 73,248.51 GiB, but as we just saw, this will add 73,198 GiB due to the new disk not having identical capacity which will cause a small “loss” in the process</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-04-add-10-drives-to-20-drive-ddp.png" alt="Expand DDP with 10 similar drives" /></p>

<p>Now our DDP has 162,264 GiB, which despite the loss of 50 GiB, is 55% more, although the number of disks went from 20 to 30. Why?</p>

<p>Because the overhead i.e. the number of preservation capacity was 2 (disks worth of capacity) and it’s still 2, which is now smaller percentage-wise (2 over 30 vs. 2 over 20 before).</p>

<p>Originally 18 disks worth of capacity were usable in a 20 large pool. We’ve added 10 so it’s 28 now.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-05-30-drives-2-preservation-cap.png" alt="30/2 DDP" /></p>

<p>Let’s change the DDP’s preservation capacity from 2 to 4 drives worth of capacity: you’d think this would drop usable by 2 x 7,319.85 GiB, but it doesn’t. It drops only 11,574 GiB (as if disks are 5,787 GiB!).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-06-30-drives-4-preservation-cap.png" alt="Change DDP preservation from 2 to 4" /></p>

<p>(N.B. The notes in these two screenshots are mine, so that I can tell which is which without looking at the file name!)</p>

<p>Because we have no volumes, nothing is used, so preservation setting can be manipulated both ways, up and down. Let’s shrink it from 4 to 3. Perhaps unexpectedly, usable capacity grows by only 5,792 GiB.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-ddp-change-number-of-reserved-drives-07-30-drives-3-preservation-cap.png" alt="Change DDP preservation from 4 to 3" /></p>

<p>The main reason is RAID 6-like protection comes * after*  preservation capacity is deducted.</p>

<h3 id="usable-capacity-calculation-in-ddp">Usable capacity calculation in DDP</h3>

<p>If you’re trying to make precise sense of the figures, let’s do a simple (the exact calculation is slightly different) calculation for 30-large DDP with 3 drives worth of preservation capacity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30/3 means 3 drives need to be deducted immediately</li>
  <li>The remainder (27) are protected in a RAID 6-like fashion, so 8+2, i.e. deduct 20%</li>
  <li>DDP uses no hot spares</li>
</ul>

<p>Capacity-wise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(30-3) x 7,319.85 x 0.8 = 158,108.76 GiB</li>
  <li>SANtricity shows (last screenshot, just above) 156,472.00 GiB, which is pretty close</li>
  <li>The exact calculation method for DDP capacity can be found in the DDP Technical Report which I’ve linked to several times - please read other DDP posts or use a search engine</li>
</ul>
