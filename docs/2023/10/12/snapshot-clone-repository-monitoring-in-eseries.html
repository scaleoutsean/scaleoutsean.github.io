<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h2>

<p>SANtricity has supported snapshots and clones forever, but monitoring them can be a challenge.</p>

<p>That is obvious if you look at the SANtricity Web UI: related information may be confusing but if you think of how it could be improved, you probably won’t have many ideas.</p>

<p>That’s because it really is more complicated than on latest “virtualized” arrays. You can see this <a href="/2023/10/05/snapshots-and-consistency-groups-with-netapp-e-series.html">post</a> for more on how E-Series snapshots and clones work. It’s complicated (at least if you compare it with SolidFire).</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s as far as the Web UI goes. What if we monitor these things externally?</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<p>First, what is it that needs to be monitored?</p>

<p>Well, various things. Let’s see a random wish list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total capacity utilization by snapshots and clones</li>
  <li>Total number of snapshots and clones</li>
  <li>Snapshots or clones hitting their capacity limit</li>
  <li>Volumes on which snapshots are about to hit their maximum number limit</li>
  <li>Snapshots or clones which have one of their repositories hitting its capacity limit</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>SANtricity already does most of these things, both monitoring and alerting.</p>

<p>It would be effective and efficient if we could reuse those metrics and alert settings and eliminate duplication of effort with possibly different settings in each place.</p>

<p>Recently I worked on <a href="/2023/09/25/monitoring-netapp-eseries-with-prtg.html">monitoring E-Series with PRTG</a> and one such monitor (“sensor”, as PRTG calls them) was added.</p>

<p>That monitor is SNMP Trap Receiver, and it lets PRTG receive alerts from SANtricity via SNMP v2 or v3 (I used v2).</p>

<p>Many other monitoring applications can receive SNMP traps or syslog, of course.</p>

<p>Second, could a monitoring application do something better?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it cannot. There’s no simple recipe for solving an alert related to SANtricity snapshots and clone.</p>

<p>The storage admin simply must visit SANtricity Web UI and decide what to do.</p>

<p>Because of that, there isn’t much that we should do in PRTG or other monitoring solution.</p>

<p>It would contain duplicate, and possibly incorrectly at that, information with no advantage over SANtricity Web UI: the end result is a storage admin must use the SANtricity UI.</p>

<h2 id="first-iteration">First iteration</h2>

<p>At first, I gathered various indicators from the API and created some derived metrics such as “GiB available”, “% full” and such.</p>

<p>In any case, the SANtricity API isn’t that easy to understand, so it took me a long time and although I had 10 metrics related to snapshots, clones and repositories, they weren’t that useful.</p>

<p>My fanciest metric was a monitor of “% full” for a special type of scheduled snapshot where the snapshot was configured to “Reject writes to base volume” when snapshot reserve gets full. If we need any kind of a snapshot-related alert, you want it for this situation where IO to base volume would simply stop! (That would be very useful for snapshots configured to avoid rotation by ransomware.)</p>

<p>But even for that useful indicator, I could configure SANtricity to send email and/or SNMP alerts from SANtricity, so why bother?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-prtg-repo-sensor-05-santricity-alert.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another problem was that some of my API-derived metrics may have been correctly obtained, but incorrectly interpreted. Or at least it seemed that way: some indicators had different values from the SANtricity Web interface. Ouch!</p>

<p>It’s not even that they were wrong - maybe they weren’t - but the issue is the moment your values <em>seem</em> different from what you see in the official Web UI, it’s game over.</p>

<h2 id="second-iteration">Second iteration</h2>

<p>I decided to change the approach and come up with a Plan B:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use SANtricity Web UI for detailed monitoring of snapshots and clones, as well as for alerting</li>
  <li>Receive alert in PRTG with SNMP Trap Receiver</li>
  <li>Use PRTG for cost-focused monitoring of snapshots and clones</li>
</ul>

<p>What do I mean by “cost-focused”? I mean “watch how much snapshots and clones cost you”.</p>

<p>If you pay $X per GIB usable, it’s easy to understand how much snapshots and clones cost you.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-prtg-repo-sensor-01-prtg-view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s just two indicators, one is the size of snapshot repos, the other is the size of clone repos. The third is a derived total (sum of these two).</p>

<p>If the cost seems too high, go to SANtricity Web UI and see what can be improved.</p>

<p>The same information can be charted, to view it over time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-prtg-repo-sensor-02-prtg-chart-view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also tried the PRTG’s new (currently still in alpha) UI - also looking good.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-prtg-repo-sensor-03-prtg-new-view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Very importantly, the sensor produces figures that match what the user sees in the array Web UI.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/eseries-prtg-repo-sensor-04-santricity-view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>All snapshot-reserved capacity related to “Groups” is snapshot capacity for individual volumes and consistency groups.</p>

<p>All clone-related capacity is about “snapshot volumes”.</p>

<p>I got sensor outputs to (roughly) match what I see in the array UI as well.</p>

<p>Related to this last point, I had an orphaned repository volume which was adding 24GB to the total shown by the SANtricity UI, so the sensor was showing a higher utilization. But this is a SANtricity issue (I should find a way to delete that orphaned repository volume).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>SANtricity snapshots and clones <em>are</em> complicated, and I guess that translates into monitoring and alerting.</p>

<p>Because of that, I recommend to fetch the minimum metrics that do not differ from those in SANtricity Web UI and use SNMP Trap Receiver for the rest.</p>

<p>Fancy metrics are possible, but in the case of anything actionable the storage admin has to check and fix it in the array interface.</p>

<p>I still like the idea of special derived metrics, but I’d probably create a limited number for specific purpose, such as anti-ransomware alerts as mentioned above. Gathering half a dozen just to flood the UI defeats the purpose.</p>
