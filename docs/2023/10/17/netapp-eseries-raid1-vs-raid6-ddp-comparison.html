<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the post <a href="/2023/10/08/raid1-in-netapp-eseries-ddp.html">Benefits of RAID 1 in E-Series DDP</a> I highlighted the performance benefit of DDP-based RAID 1 over DDP-based RAID 6 using a synthetic performance test (fio).</p>

<p>This post attempts to make that comparison more “real-life” by running a non-synthetic test using pgbench, a workload utility from PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>The subtitle refers to the “old school” RAID 5 - RAID 1 pattern. By that I mean “data on RAID 5, logs and indexes on RAID 1”.</p>

<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>PostgreSQL 14.9 (included in Ubuntu) on top of XFS filesystem</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS connected to the EF-570 via iSER</li>
  <li>x86_64 server with dual CPU (Intel Gold Xeon 6136, 3.70GHz, 2x12-cores, 48 vCPU (HT ON)) and 32 GB RAM</li>
  <li>NetApp E-Series EF-570 with 100Gbps IB
    <ul>
      <li>SANtricity OS 11.80</li>
      <li>DDP (16 disks, 2 reconstruction capacity)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Database was initiated with the following, resulting in more data than cache size.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pgbench <span class="nt">-P</span> <span class="nt">-i</span> <span class="nt">-s</span> 5000 <span class="nt">-U</span> postgres <span class="nt">-h</span> localhost postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In all tests, both RAID 1 and RAID 6 volumes were created on that DDP (in the earlier post linked at the top, I have one non-DDP test for comparison purposes. It used RAID 0).</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in that post linked at the top, I’m not confident that MPIO is working correctly (in fact I know it’s not, as one controller occasionally loses connectivity), which is why I was reluctant to run these tests at all.</p>

<p>But since the equipment is remote and it’s unlikely I’ll be able to physically inspect the network connections, I did these tests with all volumes moved to controller A, so controller B wasn’t impacting tests with its connectivity flapping (it was impacting them by depriving the array of some performance).</p>

<p>So, take these results with a grain of salt. That’s also why I’m not creating very detailed notes about the environment and benchmark.</p>

<p>These results may not be perfect, but should be reproducible and directionally confirm my expectations and the FIO results obtained in the same environment last week.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pgbench <span class="nt">-P</span> 10 <span class="nt">-c</span> 32 <span class="nt">-j</span> 32 <span class="nt">-T</span> 120 <span class="nt">-U</span> postgres <span class="nt">-h</span> localhost postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>First, what do these acronyms mean?</p>

<ul>
  <li>D - data</li>
  <li>I - indexes</li>
  <li>L - transaction logs</li>
  <li>R1 - RAID 1</li>
  <li>R6 - RAID 6</li>
</ul>

<p>DLI-R1 means data, logs and indexes were all on (DDP-based) RAID 1.</p>

<p>This chart summarizes TPS from various runs across different setups.</p>

<p>I didn’t run 3 runs in each case, but in the “important ones” (the last three here; all-R6, DI-R6-L-R1, D-R6-I-R1-L-R1) I did, whereas in other cases I ran the same test once or twice.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-results-01-tps.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first two scenarios all RAID 1-based, and if someone wants to use an all-RAID 1 configuration, they’ll probably not use DDP except in rare situations. That’s why I want to focus just on the scenarios with data on RAID 6.</p>

<p>Specifically, DLI-R6 and DI-R6-L-R1 show that by moving just the log to a separate, R1-based volume (L-R1) in the same DDP, we can get a nice performance boost.</p>

<p>If we also move the indexes, we get another boost, albeit smaller.</p>

<p>In all cases, moving transaction log or indexes (or both) to R1 volumes resulted in a 15-20% better performance.</p>

<p>We’d also expect the latency to be improving with more workloads hitting R1, and this chart proves the same.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-results-02-latency.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s a more detailed look at the (TPS) performance improvements. The “credible” tests are the first three (for some reason Excel ordered them that way):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first two bars are test with transaction log and indexes (respectively) on R1 and improvements ranging between  ~15 to &gt;20%</li>
  <li>Bar #3 all-RAID 6 (baseline)</li>
  <li>Bars #4 and #5 are all-RAID 1-on-DDP tests that we can ignore</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-results-03-improvement.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the last chart combines TPS and latency for easier viewing.</p>

<p>Although the number of tests was limited, it appears that moving WAL to RAID 1 gives the bigger boost, but moving indexes as well still manages to improve both latency and performance.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-results-04-comparison.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>(The fourth blue bar looks like TPS are almost 20% better than in the ImprovementPct chart above (where the difference is closer to 15%), but that’s because the third blue bar isn’t at 1.00; instead it’s 20,071 TPS on the right hand Y-axis.)</p>

<h2 id="other-performance-views">Other performance views</h2>

<p>I have a few more interesting charts.</p>

<p>The all-R6 test generated around 18K read and 25K write requests (~45K total).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-dil-r6-ddp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The average request size - not shown here - was over 10kB (presumably table and index requests were 8kB and transaction log IO requests were much larger).</p>

<p>With transaction logs and indexes on RAID 1 volumes, generated IOPS were more (maybe 55KB on average?) and storage throughput achieved was ~25% more (peaking at 600 MB/s).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-d-r6-i-r1-l-r1--ddp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This isn’t a screenshot from a test, but from database initialization for a test. I share it to show that this server can generate PostgreSQL data at &gt; 3 GB/s (100% write).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-d-r6-i-r1-l-r1-loading-ddp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course, this kind of throughput is when requests are large, and won’t be observed in TPC-B-like pgbench runs on the same system.</p>

<p>I’ll finish this post with two not-so-useful graphs (for this particular post): the first one is from one of those RAID 1-based runs, where all data, indexes and logs are on DDP-based RAID 1.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-r1-all-flamegraph.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second is where it’s all on “classic” RAID 6 (DDP), our baseline case in this post.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-r6-all-flamegraph.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>CPU-based flame graphs aren’t that useful for comparing the same workload across different RAID 1 configurations, but I didn’t have time to capture more logs and traces.</p>

<p>There isn’t much different except that certain activities (pglz_compress, for example) seem to go take relatively less time on RAID 1 (lower (re)write latency, I suppose?).</p>

<p>Something that applies to the both graphs is they’re quite “tall” because there’s a lot of network activities involved in client-server (even though it’s running on the same system, over loopback) and server-storage IO with iSCSI (iSCSI extensions for RDMA (iSER), in this case). Presumably the height would be even lower and performance faster with end-to-end NVMe (with EF-Series EF600, for example), but I don’t have access to that storage to compare.</p>

<p>It would look more like this (baseline case - all data on R6 - with less time spent in network-related calls for IO).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-r6-all-pgio-flamegraph.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>That should translate into performance gains with PostgreSQL as well. Not quite like this, but perhaps close to it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ddp-pgbench-dil-r6-ddp-pgio.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This and the previous post on this topic confirm RAID 1 on DDP is a valuable feature.</p>

<p>We can move transaction logs to RAID 1-like volumes in DDP, gain 15-20% in performance, and do it without sacrificing the convenience of DDP. Even the cost of extra capacity isn’t significant (just the transaction logs).</p>

<p>Similar gains should be possible with NoSQL-like databases (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, etc.).</p>
