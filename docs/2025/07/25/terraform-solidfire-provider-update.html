<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Prior to NetApp’s acquisition SolidFire had a Terraform provider for SolidFire for internal use. It was posted on Github, but never promoted to external users.</p>

<p>After SolidFire got acquired, I fought for it to be adopted and kept around as a “community” project, which NetApp has <a href="https://github.com/NetApp/terraform-provider-netapp-elementsw">done</a> and that’s been great.</p>

<p>As usual with these things, apart from the guys in that “DevOps” team to stood it up, no one ever contributed except me.</p>

<p>I was also told by some “experts” that “no one ever asked for it”.</p>

<p>Right. That’s more than obvious from the stats (screenshot of https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-elementsw/latest was taken today)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/terraform-provider-netapp-elementsw-2025-07-25.png" alt="Terraform Provider for NetApp ElementSW" /></p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-2025">What’s new in 2025</h2>

<p>Today I forked the provider.</p>

<p>You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/scaleoutsean/terraform-provider-solidfire">here</a>.</p>

<p>What’s new? Nothing, really.</p>

<p>I updated the provider to latest OSS version of Terraform (which is the old v1.5.7).</p>

<p>Why not submit a pull request to upstream?</p>

<p>There are several reasons. I briefly explained them in the new repo’s README.md, but I can’t use that file for blog-length post so here goes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As the only (albeit minor - just docs and examples) “contributor” to NetApp ElementSW provider, I couldn’t know anything that’s going on with that repo. That’s not anyone’s fault, it’s simply due to the fact that it’s managed by NetApp organization which I’m not part of</li>
  <li>However, that presented problems. As I couldn’t know anything, it didn’t make sense to try to do more (or anything at all). So I stopped trying.</li>
  <li>I also couldn’t do anything crazy in there. Not that I plan to do it here (in my fork): what I really mean is it wasn’t a place where one could screw around with experimental stuff, or even have a develop branch and ask the caretakers to spend time to manage my experiments or implicitly endorse my directions</li>
</ul>

<p>Why now, especially since SolidFire doesn’t have that much time left?</p>

<p>I just finished working on some S3/data pipeline (see the previous post, “S3 GO NATS”) and Kubernetes was on my to-do list.</p>

<p>I wanted to revisit <a href="/2024/07/05/kubefire-for-failover-failback-of-kubernetes-with-solidfire-backend.html">Kubefire</a> which kind of got stuck because - unlike Terraform provider for SolidFire - it had even less exposure (the concept, not the code) so, not knowing if anyone would use it (or otherwise get something out of it), I didn’t feel the urge to complete the last 10% and publish the code.</p>

<p>As I was looking at it again, I reluctantly agreed in my head that having a better Terraform provider would be helpful.</p>

<p>Of course it’d be helpful, I’ve always known that - and that’s why I contributed before - but who’d do it? That was the problem.</p>

<p>That’s why before I planned to create KubeFire completely outside of Kubernetes, using just a Kubernetes Python or CLI client. But when I looked at it again last night, I thought maybe I should do it better and resurrect that minimal SolidFire Operator example I have on Github.</p>

<p>Then I looked at it and recalled it was based on Ansible and Red Hat-backed <a href="https://sdk.operatorframework.io">Operator SDK</a>. Ouch.</p>

<p>So I kept looking and hit the other wall - Kubebuilder is focused on Go.</p>

<p>Then I also looked at how I’d make KubeFire work with Trident (as we’re talking about a tool that manages Trident resources, among other things) and it wasn’t possible to escape the idea that having a Terraform provider for SolidFire would help.</p>

<p>Okay, then! But the problem with current NetApp ElementSW provider is that it’s extremely basic and would need “bold” changes to make itself useful.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>I need to see if I can do something in this area. Maybe yes, maybe not. I’d need at least the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cluster pairing</li>
  <li>Volume replication pairs</li>
  <li>QoS Policy</li>
  <li>Nice-to-have
    <ul>
      <li>Volume resize</li>
      <li>Volume clone</li>
      <li>Volume snapshot</li>
      <li>Schedules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The list obviously goes on - if anything is free, anything is nice to have. But it’s not free. It requires an effort.</p>

<p>The first three are the minimum needed for replication i.e. KubeFire. So I may try that. Or QoS Policy, which is unrelated but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Needed for anyone who uses the provider as-is</li>
  <li>Probably easier for beginners</li>
  <li>Needed to potentially enable dealing with Trident’s lack of ability to <a href="/2024/06/03/pvc-volume-relationships-in-solidfire-trident-part-2.html">retype</a> SolidFire volumes which has annoyed me for a while. You can do this today only with OpenStack Cinder CSI (in the context of SolidFire)</li>
</ul>

<p>What I’ve already done is updated the sucker, which is better than nothing. And it took me seconds to publish because I can simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code> as I please. If you use Terraform v1.5, you can maybe fork this and add own stuff.</p>

<p>If I manage to add anything substantial to it, I’ll spin another version and maybe even get to use it in KubeFire. That’s the best case scenario.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I have some other ideas and use cases for SolidFire provider, but more on that if I manage to move the needle first.</p>

<p>P.S. If you use Prometheus with SolidFire - <a href="https://github.com/mjavier2k/solidfire-exporter">SolidFire Exporter</a> has been updated and added a feature related to monitoring of bulk volume jobs. The retype link above explains why that’s useful (and that’s what reminded me of the this update).</p>
