<h2 id="adjustments">“Adjustments”</h2>

<p>Last summer MinIO made <a href="/2024/08/04/fixing-ui-annoyance-with-element-blocking.html">an attempt to annoy us freeloaders</a>, but I doubt that did them much good.</p>

<p>But that was just one of the more visible - or perhaps, visual - attempts to squeeze some revenue out of the many users they have out there.</p>

<p>I don’t track them very closely so this won’t be any kind of deep-dive, but I’m keeping an eye on them.</p>

<p>Some things I remember:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deprecated “S3 gateway” (i.e. FS support) feature, probably to free some engineering resources from dealing with the constant issues from multi-protocol environments (since they can’t monetize those, i.e. non-S3, in any case)</li>
  <li>Changed to a collectivist open source license to make use by commercial users harder</li>
  <li>Threatened legal action against a friendly downstream user (Weka), which was stupid since anyone could tell Weka was well within its rights (Weka forked the product under the old license)</li>
  <li>Launched a new product, AIStor. I guess the name or purpose doesn’t matter, it was just a way to start cutting Minio (Object Store, or MinIO “Core”) features</li>
  <li>Recently, just the other day in fact, I noticed they removed all traces of MinIO “Core” downloads from the Web site. The only thing that’s easy to find is AIStor. Thankfully, the binaries are still publicly available at the old location at <a href="https://dl.min.io/">https://dl.min.io/</a>.</li>
  <li>Also recently, introduced “breaking changes” that will surely go down really well with both paying and non-paying customers</li>
  <li>And one minor, but annoying, issue is the increasing amount of marketing spam that “smaller” vendors used to be immune to. Look at the SEO/keyword spam! Whoa!!! Does anyone remember the days when it was common to use 5-10 keywords and 3-4 tags (and only if they were related to page content)?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/minio-marketing-wtf-01.png" alt="Marketing overdrive" /></p>

<p>In the case you haven’t noticed, this is everywhere. Recently I visited several similar vendors - Datastax, Influx Data and Dremio - and the mix of SEO and AI-generated spam is sickening.</p>

<p>They have the right, of course, and maybe it’s working great. But for me personally (as a hobbyist, not as a competitor), I’m not even trying to read anything but the docs. Everything else is mostly junk, increasingly AI-generated. Does it matter? I think it will.</p>

<h3 id="latest-and-greatest-breaking-changes">Latest and greatest: “breaking changes”</h3>

<p>Let’s take a look at those.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/minio-marketing-wtf-02.png" alt="Breaking changes" /></p>

<p>One could say “breaking” is mostly the removal of boringcrypto support. But the UI is going away as well, so if you use the UI, that’s breaking as well.</p>

<p>If you’re a DIY hobbyist or a DevOps dude who rarely, if ever, uses the Web UI, that’s no big deal.</p>

<p>But if you’re an SMB user who doesn’t touch MinIO as long as it works (and when you do, you use the Web UI) you may be getting nervous…. When it does break, or an upgrade fails, what are you going to look at when there’s no UI? Yes, the UI is still available, but how good it will remain is another issue.</p>

<p>Thirdly, while AIStor is backwards compatible like they say, can one “migrate” <em>from it</em> <strong>to</strong> the free version now and tomorrow? Now you may be able to, but 2-3 months down the road, maybe not. All it takes is one new “feature”.</p>

<p>Fourthly, in my opinion it’s highly likely that MinIO “core” (and <a href="https://github.com/minio/object-browser">Object Browser</a> (Web UI) that was ripped out of it) will gradually get worse.</p>

<p>The annoyances I blogged about before are getting worse (Object Store issue 3550 opened 3 days ago). I don’t think it’s <em>deliberate</em>, but we know where the priorities and resources will go now that there are <strong>two</strong> versions of everything.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/minio-marketing-wtf-03.png" alt="Object Store nagware" /></p>

<p>In the case of “Object Store”, based on the way they introduce their <a href="https://min.io/product/aistor/object-storage-global-console">Global Console feature</a>, my guess would be manageability improvements will be added to AIStor’s console and not to Object Store.</p>

<p>If 2FA or future FIPS vesions are taken out or not made available, for example, that would make the free version useless for most commercial users.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-telling-me-theres-a-chance">Are you telling me there’s a chance?</h2>

<p>They have to pay employees and suppliers and earn money for shareholders, so the above isn’t unexpected.</p>

<p>It’s probably “working” in the sense that some users, both large and medium, are happy to pay.</p>

<p>Most of MinIO’s users are simple DIY freeloaders and developer types who may pay for AWS S3 or a low cost substitute service (Backblaze, Wasabi, etc.). I don’t think these will subscribe.</p>

<p>For simple on-premises experimentation and testing, MinIO is great. But I’ve written about Versity (which is great as well and now probably even <em>better</em> for 30-40% of on-premises use cases) and there are others.</p>

<p>MinIO’s challenge is S3 is a very standardized and extremely commoditized software product (service). I think they’d do well if a server maker (say, Lenovo) bought them.</p>

<p>As-is, paying customers will want to buy properly supported storage servers - and MinIO has just 3 (SM, Dell, HPE) partners - OS and software. By the time one pays everyone involved, things can get complicated technically, support-wise and sales-wise.</p>

<p>Weka and Vast have similar go-to-market and from what I see and hear I think that’s far from friction-free. (I also used to work for ISVs with similar GTM approaches and it was messy.)</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>I expect that most customers who pay for S3 software and have 100s of TBs of on-premises object storage will see MinIO as risky.</p>

<p>Even with the free version, I never hear of someone moving <em>to</em> MinIO. I’m sure some do and don’t tell me, but it’s probably in dozens. I’ve never heard of any cases in APAC. Freeloaders are many.</p>

<p>What’s different compared to Weka and Vast is MinIO is normally used for high-latency workloads. I know “AIStor” is awesome for low-latency workloads, but paying users  who need low latency usually also need high availability and uptime, which means on-premises or at least in-country support.</p>

<p>For high-latency bulk workloads it’s attractive (cost-wise, risk-wise, features-wise) to use Tier 2 S3 service providers.</p>

<p>In theory, there’s “no lock-in”, but as we all know, when you EC across a bunch of servers, a crappy one makes the entire N+M set work like crap. Two clusters, two server markers is fine. But I wouldn’t mix different server suppliers in one cluster.</p>

<p>Also in theory, MinIO is well-behaved for small files (I mean, objects). Fast metadata, lightweight, some proprietary S3 API calls… In practice, since the AI craze has started, people have been taking notice of that opportunity.</p>

<p>Now even S3 software is differentiated enough that we’re back to people having two (S3) suppliers in order to de-risk, get better prices or maybe buy a smaller “scratch/temp” S3 for AI while they keep a trusted on-premises S3 vendor for backups and other things they intend to keep around for a decade or five. And even when it comes to small object workloads, there are faster alternatives and MinIO <a href="/2024/10/14/minio-versitygw-s3-performance-netapp-ef-series.html">can be slow</a>.</p>

<p>It won’t be easy for them. I think MinIO will have a tough time converting many of the freeloaders to paying customers.</p>

<p>I also think a free fork may appear soon if they drive “Core” and “Object Store” into the ground. As I’ve noted above, the Web site is becoming increasingly useless and one can’t even get to (free) software downloads from it. They’re moving closer to “danger zone” as far as forks are concerned.</p>
