<p>My post title doesn’t even have a question mark, but I tentatively reached the same conclusion.</p>

<h2 id="who-wants-it-and-why">Who wants it and why?</h2>

<p>No one is asking. Maybe some SolidFire users would want it - I don’t know.</p>

<p>But as IT teams (mostly SMB, from what I see) kick tires on various “alternatives”, sometimes they ask about plugins (not specifically SolidFire, but “overall”).</p>

<p>My <a href="/2022/04/05/proxmox-solidfire.html">“SolidFire with Proxmox”</a> post gets visitors every now and again, so I figure there may be half a dozen users out there.</p>

<p>SolidFire is simple and easy to use. There isn’t that much to automate and I don’t know if there’s much value in making what’s already incredibly easy, easier…</p>

<p>Maybe there is a little. Someone would need to make that happen, though. At this time - with <a href="/2022/09/23/eoa-solidfire.html">not much time left</a> before End of Support arrives.</p>

<p>But still, I was curious so I looked at this “<a href="https://github.com/kolesa-team/pve-purestorage-plugin">community</a>” plugin for Pure Storage.</p>

<p>Let’s see…</p>

<h2 id="perl-for-the-win">Perl for the win!</h2>

<p>Proxmox “PVE” storage plugins are written in Perl. That is hilarious!</p>

<p>I last used Perl in 2003 (I guess) and around 2010 I probably already thought I’d never need to use it again.</p>

<p>But here we are… I heard some rumors about Rust as well, so I took a look at these two.</p>

<p>Simple Perl script for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ListAccounts</code> method in Python API has been <a href="https://github.com/scaleoutsean/awesome-solidfire/commit/833dcf0c66dae8ea1e024fc867372448e94a4edc">posted</a> to my Awesome SolidFire repository.</p>

<p>In the same commit I made a Rust example.</p>

<p>So okay, Perl is possible, but unpleasant.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>I always thought VMware plugins were monstrosities, especially the ones bloated Java-based ones (before vSphere v7).</p>

<p>I’ve no idea if they were “bloated”, but they certainly seemed so. And there were <strong>always</strong> some bugs. Year after year. Spot a bug if you do this, spot a bug if you do that, spot a bug if you upgrade vCenter… I tend to RTFM so I didn’t encounter as many, but it was a terrible experience.</p>

<p>Proxmox storage plugins look exactly like I’d expect a storage plugin to look except for the fact that they’re written in Perl.</p>

<p>This one has around 1,000 lines of code, and the usual features: create, grow, delete, purge, snapshot, clone and restore (from a snapshot).</p>

<p>SolidFire’s API is probably easier to use than Pure’s and unlike that plugin (iSCSI and FC), we don’t have to deal with FC. Yay!</p>

<p>We also don’t have to deal with multi-pathing (which seems like a big deal in this Pure Storage plugin), because every SolidFire who did it right does not <strong>have</strong> a multi-pathing SAN. Why? Because they use LACP or (maybe even) a single physical path to Solidfire storage.</p>

<p>So, it should be very easy to re-purpose the Pure plugin, right?</p>

<h2 id="effort">Effort</h2>

<p>I’ve started doing some search &amp; replace work, but I’m still not determined to go further.</p>

<p>But if anyone wants to try, it’s worth looking at.</p>

<p>I don’t have a Proxmox environment so I’d have to set that up, and then I could try my “SolidFire plugin”, see how each of those storage functions fails, fix them one by one, test and document. Writing five or six API methods is not even half the effort.</p>

<p>Since now one is asking and there are other pressing things to do (and where Perl isn’t required), I doubt I’ll try to make that happen. If I do, I’ll update this post.</p>
